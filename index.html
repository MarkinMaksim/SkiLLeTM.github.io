    	<h2>INTERESTS</h2>
    	<p class="attention" >I like sports life.</p> 
		<p>I can't live without music, that's probably why ballroom dancing was my hobby about 8 years.</p>
		<p class="attention">To do before the end</p>
		<p>If i haven't done my work, i can't sleep. That's why i love the saying "Сделал дело гуляй смело" or "Business before pleasure".</p>
